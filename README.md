# Furever ComFUNion

![Logo](path/to/logo.png)

## Overview

"Furever ComFUNion" is an extensive database system designed to streamline the adoption and rehoming process for animals with fur and paws. Our system offers a range of features including:

- Adoption/rehoming tracking
- Applicant management
- Animal registration

The database maintains comprehensive profiles for adoptable animals, detailing their species, breed, age, and any special needs. It also tracks the status of prospective adopters' appointments and transactions. Additionally, the system allows clients to schedule appointments for adoptions or rehoming, subject to veterinarian approval. In summary, "Furever ComFUNion" serves as a centralized platform connecting animals in need of homes with loving adopters, ensuring a smooth and efficient adoption and rehoming process for all parties involved.

## Business Rules

- Each application requires a veterinarian to manage it.
- A maximum of 5 pets is permitted per application.
- Veterinarians' services are not exclusive to a single application.
- Each pet has its own appointment.
- Clients can adopt and rehome animals, and vice versa.
